      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Both poker and basketball require a combination of skill, strategy, and
        mental toughness. While they may seem like very different games, many of
        the psychological and strategic elements overlap. This page explores how
        the skills used in poker can be applied to basketball, and vice versa.

    <section id="decision-making">
      <h2>Decision-Making</h2>
      <p>
        In both poker and basketball, quick and accurate decision-making is
        crucial. Whether it's deciding to take a shot or fold a hand, players
        need to weigh their options and choose the best course of action.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="risk-management">
      <h2>Risk Management</h2>
      <p>
        Both games involve risk management. Poker players often have to decide
        when to bet big and when to hold back, just like basketball players must
        decide when to take a high-risk shot or pass to a teammate.
      </p>

    <section id="psychological-aspects">
      <h2>Psychological Aspects</h2>
      <p>
        Reading opponents and staying calm under pressure are key components of
        both poker and basketball. Players must understand their opponents'
        strategies and tendencies while maintaining composure.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="strategy">
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        Both poker and basketball involve complex strategies. In poker, this
        might mean playing aggressively or passively based on the situation. In
        basketball, it could involve offensive and defensive tactics tailored to
        exploit the opponent's weaknesses.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Mastering decision-making, risk management, psychological insight, and
        strategic planning can make one a better player in both poker and
        basketball. These skills are universally valuable, bridging the gap
        between the poker table and the basketball court.
