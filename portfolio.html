          <p>
            In my senior year of high school, I was a part of a program called
            the Independent Study & Mentorship program, otherwise known as
            "ISM". In ISM, I found a candidate for a mentor through cold
            contacting and interviewing and that mentor is an engineer for game
            development. Because of that, I was inspired to work in Unity (C#)
            to code my own version of minesweeper (which I was hooked on playing
            at the time). On screen is the hard mode, but I had easy and medium
            mode implemented as well. I then exported the project using WebGL so
            that others could play my version of minesweeper online.

          <p>
            For my internship's codeathon, we set up a login/authentication
            system, an admin view, a user view, and an interface to display the
            statistics of which interns chose what project to be a part of for
            the summer. We utilized Paycom's native React UI Library to display
            this information. I was personally responsible for the visualization
            of data for each project.

          <p>
            Using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) I want to
            create an E-Commerce Website from scratch that will allow users to
            view products, add them to their cart, then go through a checkout
            process that ensures that payment and shipping is secure. This would
            serve mostly as a way to hone my skills in the full-stack area
            rather than serve a purpose in my day-to-day life.

            Using React and Web-Scraping technologies, my plan would be to
            collect advanced statistics that influenced past MVP races to
            estimate chances of each candidate of the MVP race is likely to win.
            I would then build a user interface that lays out the necessary
            information that would dictate a favorite in hopes that my personal
            favorite, Luka Doncic, will be at the top of the list.
